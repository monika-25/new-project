        <p>So you thought that there was nothing to Chennai's dining scene other than dosa and filter coffee? Well, perhaps that was true twenty years ago but no longer - the juggernaut of modernity has swept in, changing Chennai's food landscape dramatically. Of course it has the ubiquitous Italian / European / Chinese / Thai restaurants but now you can also find Russian food, a ramen joint, Korean restaurants and far, far more. In Chennai, you can now go round the world on a plate.</p>

<h2>Go Go Ramen</h2>

<p>Chennai is having a bit of a love affair with Japanese food at the moment. It's no wonder then that the city is home to India's only ramen bar - GoGo Ramen.  GoGo's version of ramen is swollen with slow-braised pork, kombu and a soft-boiled egg in a tawny pork broth flavoured with scallions, ginger and leek. Although the restaurant also offers grilled chicken and vegetarian versions, its signature pork ramen is definitely the best of the three. The Gyoza (pot sticker) wrappers are appropriately silky thin. The Gua Bao (Taiwanese braised pork belly buns) in a delicious sauce is an explosion of salty-sweet flavours. And then there is cold barley tea to wash it all down with.

		<h2>Winter Palace</h2>

		<p>It is as pretty as a picture. The stark blue-white façade, the crisp napery, the baroque architecture - all add to the experience of dining at a Russian palace. Hunker down and plough through Piroshki (little meat pies), the delicious Blinis (crepe-like pockets oozing with honey, sour cream or ice cream), a variety of hearty Russian dumplings and delicious cured, salted fish.

		<h2>Shiraz Cafe</h2>
    <img src="pilot/images/res-3-625_625x350_81438945442.jpg"/>
		<p>It's Iran's gift to Chennai, the Shiraz Art Café at Neelankarai beach. In its pretty alfresco environs, the waves lapping the shore nearby, it's easy to leave behind the soggy cares of the outside world. Shiraz's version of Ghaalieh Mahi Fish is as authentic as it gets; served with a slick of coriander gravy. Its Bademjan is slowly stewed with mutton, tomato and aubergine. Perhaps best of all though is Shiraz's Sunday brunch, a massive buffet of home-style Irani cooking.</p>
